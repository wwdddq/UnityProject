## Background
In a mysterious space station, scientists have conducted a ground-breaking experiment in memory. They developed a technology called the "Memory Fusion Device", which can fuse human memories directly into the physical environment. However, the experiment exploded and the device's energy stones were split into four parts and scattered in different spaces. Only by collecting the scattered pieces of energy stones by walking through the four spaces following the routes remembered in the fusion device, can people restore the space station to its normal state. Now you are the hero of this mission and only your memory and skill can save this mysterious space station.
